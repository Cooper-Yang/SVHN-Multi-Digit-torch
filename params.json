  "body": "### Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.\r\nThis deep learning model follows the [2014 paper by Goodfellow et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6082), which allows an end to end multiple digits classification for numbers of up to 5 digits. The model extracts a 4096 nodes feature vector using a CNN network and then applies 6 linear classifiers on it - one classifier for the length of the number and 5 classifiers for the individual digits.\r\nThe model can be applied for numbers OCR for up to 5 digits in blurry, rotated and messy images.\r\n\r\n### Model Structure\r\nThe model consists of:\r\n* A preprocessing script - create_dataset.lua \r\n* A training script - model.lua \r\n* An evaluation script - eval.lua\r\nIt is possible to train the model or use a supplied trained model which achieves 95.4% accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Trained Model\r\nThe trained model can be downloaded from http://www.terminet.xyz/datasets/model.zip\r\n\r\n### Requirements \r\nThe model requires Torch7 including the following packages:\r\n* nn (for the model structure)\r\n* optim (for the model optimization)\r\n* dp (for checkpoint loading)\r\n* cutorch, cunn (for using CUDA)\r\n\r\n### Training Example\r\n```\r\nth model.lua -save 'model.net' -epochs 50\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Evaluation Example\r\n```\r\nth eval.lua -load 'model.net' -image 'data/1.png'\r\n```",
